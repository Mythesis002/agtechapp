# OAuth "Failed to exchange code for token" Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® **Current Issue**
You're experiencing the error: **"Failed to exchange code for token"**

This is one of the most common OAuth errors and typically indicates an issue with the token exchange process during authentication.

## üîç **What This Error Means**

The "Failed to exchange code for token" error occurs when:
1. **Authorization code expires** (OAuth codes are short-lived)
2. **Network connectivity issues** prevent the token exchange
3. **OAuth service problems** on the server side
4. **Configuration mismatches** between client and server
5. **Rate limiting** from too many authentication attempts

## üöÄ **Immediate Solutions (Try These First)**

### **1. Refresh and Retry**
```
‚Ä¢ Refresh the page completely
‚Ä¢ Try signing in again
‚Ä¢ Wait 5-10 seconds between attempts
```

### **2. Clear Browser Data (Web Only)**
```
‚Ä¢ Clear browser cache and cookies
‚Ä¢ Try incognito/private browsing mode
‚Ä¢ Try a different browser
```

### **3. Restart App (Mobile Only)**
```
‚Ä¢ Close the app completely
‚Ä¢ Restart the app
‚Ä¢ Try signing in again
```

## ‚è∞ **Wait and Retry Strategy**

OAuth authorization codes expire quickly (usually within 5-10 minutes). If you've been trying for a while:

1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** before trying again
2. **Don't rapidly click** the sign-in button
3. **Let the process complete** before retrying

6. App receives access token and user info
```

### **Common Causes**
- Authorization code expired
- Network timeout during token exchange
- OAuth service temporarily unavailable
- Client configuration issues
- Rate limiting

### **Prevention**
- Don't rapidly retry authentication
- Implement proper retry logic with backoff
- Monitor OAuth service status
- Provide clear user feedback
